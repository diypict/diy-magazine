Select your best images if you�re not sure which of your photos are the best, ask an art teacher, your classmates, or anyone you know who has attended a photography college for help. The portfolio is, essentially, a collection of writing by a student in a course, informed by reflective thinking and writing, which allows students to look back and think forward.</p>
<h3 id="a-portfolio-supports-you-in-your-role-as-an-academic-by-creating-a-record-of-your-reflection-development-and-achievements-over-time">A Portfolio Supports You In Your Role As An Academic By Creating A Record Of Your Reflection, Development And Achievements Over Time.</h3><p>Large pieces of work or delicate items may be shown as photographs. Think first about your audience. Convert these to pdf files. Ponder your progress most portfolio assessments require you to write a reflective letter, an introduction that explains the evolution of your writing and the choices you made in compiling your work.</p>
