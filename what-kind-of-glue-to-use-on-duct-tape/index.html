As a result, duct tape manufacturers now offer a wide range of grades of polyethylene/fabric types and in a wide variety of colors. The name suggests that the tape is for use on air ducts, like what you would find in your basement, however creative people soon figured out there�s loads more applications possible for this sticky stuff. People usually start by putting it on the middle and then run it to the sides to seal up the sides.</p>
<h3 id="the-adhesive-found-on-duct-tape-is-very-firm">The Adhesive Found On Duct Tape Is Very Firm.</h3><p>Duct tape is a powerful adhesive, but it leaves behind a strong, sticky residue. This is the best tape for heating ducts. Glue backed or impregnated adhesive tapes of various sorts were in use by the 1910s, including rolls of cloth tape with adhesive coating one side. To make duct tape, the fabric is covered in melted polythene, which protects it from moisture and erosion.</p>
