<h3 id="if-while-you-are-lifting-your-hair-the-mixture-begins-to-get-dry-and-nearly-crumbly-applies-more-of-the-mix-to-keep-the-hair-from-drying-out">If While You Are Lifting Your Hair, The Mixture Begins To Get Dry And Nearly Crumbly Applies More Of The Mix To Keep The Hair From Drying Out.</h3><p>What we need to do is place one tape at the bottom, stick to your hair, and close tape with one on top. Yes, you can use curling irons and flat irons on your extensions, but remember that itï¿½s real hair, so it can burn just like your own hair. This is vital, you will literally rip your head of hair out if you try and brush them continuously with a normal brush, so seriously get one, they are only about. Holly i think hair sewn in extensions are gross because they create tangles , breakage, and just end up looking bad.</p>
