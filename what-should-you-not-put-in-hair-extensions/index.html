Yes, you can use curling irons and flat irons on your extensions, but remember that it�s real hair, so it can burn just like your own hair. This is vital, you will literally rip your head of hair out if you try and brush them continuously with a normal brush, so seriously get one, they are only about. Holly i think hair sewn in extensions are gross because they create tangles , breakage, and just end up looking bad.</p>
