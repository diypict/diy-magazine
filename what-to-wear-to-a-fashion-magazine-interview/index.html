What you wear for a fashion firm’s interview is different from what you wear to an investment bank’s interview. A navy blue blazer is a breath of fresh air from the typical black suit coat and a great addition to your interviewing wardrobe. Or should i be taking a whole different route?</p>
<h3 id="i039m-thinking-either-wide-leg-tweed-trousers-crisp-white-shirt-and-black-vest-with-a-statement-necklace-and-red-heels-or-a-fuchsia-sheath-dress-with-jacket-hose-and-booties">I�m Thinking Either Wide Leg Tweed Trousers, Crisp White Shirt And Black Vest, With A Statement Necklace And Red Heels, Or A Fuchsia Sheath Dress With Jacket, Hose And Booties.</h3><p>I wouldn’t wear ripped jeans though. You can wear it with a tie or without, depending on the dress code. A suitable interview outfit will be black jeans, a blazer, and a striped top that is worn with fantastic accessories that are black. A khaki skirt is a good addition to your working wardrobe because it can be worn with many different tops.</p>
