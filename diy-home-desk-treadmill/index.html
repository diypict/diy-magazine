Long story short, my wife needed a treadmill desk, and we don�t have the resources to buy one (they run hundreds of dollars). But i can imagine, one day in the future, bringing my walkingpad into the office and. 1) measure the arms of your treadmill to ensure your sizes are correct.</p>
<h3 id="with-the-board-diy-treadmill-desk-you-can-design-your-treadmill-at-home">With The Board Diy Treadmill Desk, You Can Design Your Treadmill At Home.</h3><p>Just make sure that the width of the desk legs allow for the 24″ width of the rebel treadmill or 29″ for the lifespan. This diy treadmill desk is the perfect solution for an easy way to get some exercise and still have things organized around you at all times. When you are done with all that, you can start adding accessories to your new diy treadmill desk. This instructable documents the building of three treadmill desks, the motivation behind walking while you work at your computer or talk on the phone, and gives our anecdotal evidence for how and why this has worked for us.</p>
<h3 id="5-cut-two-pieces-of-wood-one-side-on-a-5-degree-angle">5) Cut Two Pieces Of Wood, One Side On A 5 Degree Angle.</h3><p>Diy walking desk materials 24″ x 10″ x 2″ floating shelf folding shelf brackets 24″ x 14″ x 5/8″ melamine shelf (note you will have to cut 4″ off of this shelf to make it 20″ wide otherwise it won’t fit in between the bars of the treadmill) you can also buy iron on edge tape to cover up your cut. As seen in the picture below, the side poles were cut off leaving on about 14 inches from the ground to give stability to the treadmill. Finally attach the arms to the board using 8 screws on each arm, two in each corner. This requires evacuating the armrests and the console and setting a standing desk over the treadmill.</p>
