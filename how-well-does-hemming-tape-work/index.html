I used this tape and, viola, they looked perfectly hemmed after i applied it easily with an iron.</p>
<h3 id="hem-tape-will-work-on-polyester-fabric-and-most-other-materials-that-can-withstand-heat">Hem Tape Will Work On Polyester Fabric And Most Other Materials That Can Withstand Heat.</h3><p>What is the purpose of hemming tape? People new to or not very skilled at sewing can use hem tape as a work around to hand or machine stitching. However, if you have to alter the hem later, or want to put in a permanent sewn seam, you need to remove the hem tape from the fabric. This iron on hem tape works wonders.</p>
