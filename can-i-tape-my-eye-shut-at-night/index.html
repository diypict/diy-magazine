<h3 id="i-put-some-gel-in-and-tape-it-closed">I Put Some Gel In And Tape It Closed.</h3><p>Put gauze over the eye first…gently hold your eye closed with your fingers while sticking the tape across the gauze pads and make sure you tear a big enouygh strip of tape to tape a little over y=the pad to your forehead and cheek (i never tried side to side taping. I tried a small piece of tape one night in november, just to be sure. The added weight could help make it easier to keep the eyes closed. To tape the upper lid closed for sleeping, take another piece of tape the same width.</p>
