<h3 id="put-a-garden-line-down-when-sowing-seeds-as-this-will-allow-you-to-tell-the-young-radish-seed-from-young-weeds-when-growing">Put A Garden Line Down When Sowing Seeds As This Will Allow You To Tell The Young Radish Seed From Young Weeds When Growing.</h3><p>The small, round varieties will get woody if grown in hot temperatures. The secret to growing a great radish is to plant when the soil is cool, to not plant too close together, and to harvest promptly before the roots get woody and bitter. Before they are fully mature, radish seed pods are tender and juicy with a wonderfully sharp flavour. Radishes are also used as a catch crop, being sown in between rows of slower growing vegetables.</p>
