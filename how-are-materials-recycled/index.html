The term ârecycled building materialsâ usually refers to concrete, asphalt shingles, steel, wood, glass, drywall, and flooring. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state.</p>
