<h3 id="you-can-unlock-new-items-to-buy-by-building-stores-at-the-mall-check-out-my-post-here-to-find-out-what-unlocks-in-each-store">You Can Unlock New Items To Buy By Building Stores At The Mall, Check Out My Post Here To Find Out What Unlocks In Each Store.</h3><p>I won the swimsuit challenge and was able to pick different suits up until the latest update. Adding, editing &amp; deleting sims. Otherwise, sims are always clothed wherever they go. Normally, the only way to cancel an action in the sims freeplay is to pay lp to finish the action early.</p>
