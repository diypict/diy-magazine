Thoroughly mix your can of paint with a wooden paint stir stick for at least 1 minute. Then place another line of glue on the fabric, just slightly under where the dowel is sitting, so that you can roll the dowel down onto this new line of glue and the fabric will roll with the dowel. If you�ve got a fabric stash, this is the perfect project.</p>

Originally tapestry was woven entirely by hand. At the top of your tapestry, place a thin line of glue on the top edge of the back side of the base fabric. I�ve woven fabric strips to make baby blankets, tablecloths, wall hangings, clothes, and yes, even rugs.</p>

Flip your frame so the back is facing up, and lay out the tapestry once more. To prevent fraying and to attach the trim, you can apply a thin layer of fabric glue along the edges of the tapestry or sew everything down. I think my favorite is the wall hangings in which i weave the fabric strips into shapes, much like tapestry weaving.</p>
