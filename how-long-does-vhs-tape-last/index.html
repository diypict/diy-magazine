<h3 id="how-long-is-that-shelf-life">How Long Is That Shelf Life?</h3><p>The vcr has three default settings: Every time the tape is played, it is running the tape physically against the play head of the vcr. Some tapes play adequately and some have lost enough of the magnetic coating to have issues. How long do vhs tapes last?</p>
<h3 id="the-length-of-the-cassette-tape-and-the-recording-settings-on-your-vcr">The Length Of The Cassette Tape And The Recording Settings On Your Vcr.</h3><p>Given how long vhs has been obsolete, chances are that your old tapes have already reached, if not exceeded, this time frame. Kodak recommends converting your vhs tapes to cds. But when i started this process i had a lot of tapes that were close to 15 and they mostly transferred well. A vhs tape uses a magnetic charge to store the information that is recorded on them, both video and audio.</p>
