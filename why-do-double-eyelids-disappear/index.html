So when the eyes are closed there is the amount of skin. But the embedding double eyelid will disappear after a long time, so why would anyone choose to do embedding? The factors for this loss may be divided into surgeon factor and patient factor.</p>
<h3 id="closing-the-lids-or-mostly-doing-so-would-reveal-that-fold">Closing The Lids (Or Mostly Doing So) Would Reveal That Fold.</h3><p>I don�t really have any suggestions beyond eyelid tape, sorry :/ but on me, flipping to a monolid is an indication that i�m not eating right, sleeping/exercising enough, or drinking too much/little water. One of my eyes flips from double to mono and back again. We all inherit certain genes and features from our parents that we sometimes wish were different. Inflammation of the eyelids, or blepharitis, caused by a problem with the oil glands near the base of the eyelids, a bacterial infection, or skin conditions.</p>
