Once the layers are all together, use a piece of cardstock that goes with your color scheme for a base. This comes in 14 shades and you can use some of the darker shades to contour (easy to travel with these). Is tarte’s shape tape concealer all that it is hyped up to be?</p>

As a contour product, absolutely not. It definitely does dry quickly and it won’t budge once it sets but it still leaves a radiance to the skin. I created this video because so many tarte shape tape tutorials show it being applied in this big triangular shape underneath the eye.</p>

Does dry down to a super matte finish which works for oily eye area, but for dry skin, make sure to properly moisturize the skin first. The larger, domed side can be used to soften any harsh lines. Cons of tarte shape tape contour concealer:</p>
