You have to size the string to fit your head tightly. Grab a strand of hair and then wrap the braid around it once.</p>
<h3 id="you039ve-got-yourself-a-bouncy-ponytail-that039s-right-on-trend">You�ve Got Yourself A Bouncy Ponytail That�s Right On Trend.</h3><p>Start off with hair in the front of your head, as it�s easier to control. Bobby pin the hair above tightly. An inaccurate color match will make your extensions very obvious. That means you can dye it, curl it, straighten it, wash it, and style it however you want to.</p>
