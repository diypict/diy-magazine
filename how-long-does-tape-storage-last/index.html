Although the vhs life expectancy varies from one vhs tape to the next, vhs tapes have been found to deteriorate 10 to 20 percent over the course of 10 to 25 years. However, to be sure of how long your tape is certified or how long its shelf life is, make sure to consult your tapeï¿½s manufacturer or your converter. In addition, they are designed to be a long lasting solution that can store data for decades.</p>

Tape this is probably going to surprise a few of you, but premium grade tape backup can last 50 years.</p>

Tape storage has an advantage that most hard disk drives donât,the format is designed to be rugged enough to be stored for up to 30 years, something that cannot be guaranteed for other forms of.
