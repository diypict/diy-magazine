Orders are late, refunds can take a while, quality is lacking and the customer service is a 3/10. They mostly fast fashion quality, but i like their patterns and they are fun. Buy the stuff you think looks cool, if it’s shit quality return it.</p>
<h3 id="as-an-additional-benefit-for-younger-online-shoppers-the-company-also-offers-a-10-percent-student-discount-on-its-clothing">As An Additional Benefit For Younger Online Shoppers, The Company Also Offers A 10 Percent Student Discount On Its Clothing.</h3><p>I love asos and i love that topshop is also a part of them now (yayyy). Asos used to be amazing 5+ years ago. Yes, asos is one of the most trusted and most visited online shopping websites in united kingdom. I’ve spent over £500 on asos in the past 12 months this is the second order issue (first issue was not resolved in a satisfactory manner) i therefore will make this my last order if asos do not rectify this.</p>
