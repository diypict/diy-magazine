<p>Anyone who’s into the model side of the warhammer 40k hobby knows how expensive it can be. Moulding and casting a model as detailed as a 40k model could be expensive (wasn�t sure on this one until a friendly commenter told me that the moulds for the models can be “horrifyingly expensive”, depending on the model) 40k sets tend to also include a lot of little tidbits that really don’t need to be there. Additionally, death guard armies have access to poxwalkers, which are among some of the most affordable models in all of warhammer 40,000. Best of 2016 Golden Demon Warhammer, Warhammer 40k.</p>
