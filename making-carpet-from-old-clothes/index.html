Rose july 30, 2017 how to reuse your old clothes to make rugs, carpet, table mat…a floor covering of thick woven material or animal skin, typically not extending over the entire floor. Grab some old sheets and start crafting them into a rug!</p>
<h3 id="reply-9-months-ago-reply-upvote">Reply 9 Months Ago Reply Upvote.</h3><p>If you have any feedback or suggestions please drop a comment to let us know. I just finished my first rug and had a huge problem with fraying. Secure the fabric in place with fabric glue around the perimeter on the backside. Be sure to cut one layer of the shirt and cut all the way around (through the opposite seam) until you get to within 2 to 3 inches of where you started cutting.</p>

This is a great idea if you need multiple rugs around the house and want them all to stick to a specific theme. I went searching on the internet and found this beautiful woven rug idea from master hands on youtube and knew this would work great for all. While we are in isolation, ive learnt a new skill, making a simple rug using old clothes.my husband has already asked for me to make a hammock now.music:</p>
