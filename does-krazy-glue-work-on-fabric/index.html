Krazy glue is defiantly super until it ends up on your clothes. Although super glue is technically one of the best glues out there, one of its most common uses is for arts and crafts. The e6000 adhesive is a very versatile product so you can use it on just about any project that you want to work on.</p>
<h3 id="its-the-kind-of-glue-you-can-use-for-rhinestones-patches-denim-and-putting-those-police-badges-on-cosplay-outfits">It’s The Kind Of Glue You Can Use For Rhinestones, Patches, Denim And Putting Those Police Badges On Cosplay Outfits.</h3><p>Fabric glue won’t stain your clothes as much as super glue would. Wait a few days before washing the piece of clothing to make sure the bond is secure. Krazy glue can only bond a small percentage of materials, even though most of them work. This ensures you don’t get any messy drips when applying it like other types of glues might be prone to do while they are too cold or too warm.</p>
<h3 id="in-fact-you-can-use-this-product-on-a-variety-of-materials-including-metal-glass-clay-seashells-rocks-beads-ceramic-wood-and-even-fabric">In Fact, You Can Use This Product On A Variety Of Materials, Including Metal, Glass, Clay, Seashells, Rocks, Beads, Ceramic, Wood And Even Fabric.</h3><p>After letting the glue dry, swab some eliminator on and also let it go to function. If you want to use this product, please do not use paper, foam, rear view mirrors, polyethylene, teflon® or any other fluorocarbon. Though it works with most, krazy glue cannot bond all materials. Meant instantly to bond to most surfaces in just a matter of minutes, it takes only seconds for it to bond to clothes or fabrics, ruining them.</p>
