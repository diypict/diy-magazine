Sprains, muscle strains, subluxations, and tendonitis. We recommend that you do not wear it for more than 5 days. Kt tape provides support and pain relief before, during, and/or after an activity.</p>
<h3 id="kenzo-kase-founder-of-kinesio-based-on-deep-insight-into-skin-and-tissue-physiology-and-its-relationship-to">Kenzo Kase, Founder Of Kinesio, Based On Deep Insight Into Skin And Tissue Physiology And Its Relationship To.</h3><p>“can you use kinesiology tape on your face?” do you really want or need to do this?? Kt tape is an elastic sports tape designed to relieve pain while supporting muscles, tendons, and ligaments. it is applied to the skin using various methods, and is primarily used for pain relief however there are also many claims about its benefits including, but limited to. In a test of ankle stability by doyel et al., kinesio tape helped just as much as athletic tape or another generic tape. Unlike standard athletic taping, which is rigid and locks a joint and its musculature in place, kt tape is elastic and allows the body to move through its natural range of motion.</p>
<h3 id="seriously-that039s-the-only-thing-i-can-come-up-with">Seriously, That�s The Only Thing I Can Come Up With!</h3><p>The other brand still sticks well &amp; performs as promised. General athletic tape can provide support as well as kinesio tape. Although an expiration date is not required for surgical tapes in the us, an expiration date is required by a number of other countries. With kt tape capable of being left on the body safely for up to 4 days without losing any benefit, it becomes clear that the kind of stability the tape offers often blows traditional knee braces right out of the water.</p>
<h3 id="in-general-we-do-not-expect-changes-in-performance-shortly-after-the-expiration-date-but-3m-ensures-performance-within-that-time-frame">In General, We Do Not Expect Changes In Performance Shortly After The Expiration Date, But 3M Ensures Performance Within That Time Frame.</h3><p>Typically, shelf life for a pressure sensitive adhesive is one year when stored out of direct sunlight, in ideal temperatures of 60 to 80 degrees fahrenheit and at 40 to 50 percent relative humidity. Spider tech man, thank you for your weird question. Does the adhesive have an expiration date? Kinesiology tape is almost similar to skin.</p>
