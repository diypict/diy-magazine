Throw into a basket with holes (for aeration) and wash with hot water. Any item of clothing can become a rag. You can use them for any cleaning as long as they�re not too dirty before you start.</p>
<h3 id="but-on-hilly-paths-it-slips-a-bit-until-it-gets">But On Hilly Paths, It Slips A Bit Until It Gets.</h3><p>I:co (short for i:collect) is a german textile recycling company that collects textile items from participating retail partners, sorts the old clothing, and either reuses or recycles them in order to make closed loop recycling in the clothing industry. Long ago, when clothes are so worn that they were no more useful to wear, they were hardly thrown away and too old to be given out. By using old clothes as dust rags and mops, you can use fewer cleaning products, protect the environment and prevent exposure to harmful toxins. Wash rags this is by far the most obvious strategy and my personal favorite.</p>
