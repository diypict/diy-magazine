If you really think about it, you keep those clothes because you can’t let go of the way you used to look when you were wearing them.</p>
<h3 id="i-mean-when-you-say-that-you-throw-them-out-because-they-do-not-fit-is-it-because-you-grew-or-gained-mass">I Mean When You Say That You Throw Them Out Because They Do Not Fit Is It Because You Grew Or Gained Mass.</h3><p>When selling a large number of clothes, separate them by category and organize them by color. You can always send your old clothes for recycling. Keeping old and unused clothes is almost like personal baggage. Not wearing certain pieces of clothing is a sign that you just don’t like it anymore.</p>
