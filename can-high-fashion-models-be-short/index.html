Male models can usually get away with 6’3″ but any taller than that. I can get on board with a good ‘tailored’ look,. In some cases, very tall by most standards.</p>
<h3 id="we-took-a-closer-look">We Took A Closer Look.</h3><p>The models we will be discussing today are all shorter than this. The modeling industry has tossed aside its strict height requirements for both male and female models and is now embracing smaller models (not to mention models of any size, age, and ethnicity too!). Thanks to a boom in brands catering for men and women with smaller frames and shorter legs, petite models are being employed to keep up with industry demand. Sometimes people complain that fashion can only look good on models.</p>
