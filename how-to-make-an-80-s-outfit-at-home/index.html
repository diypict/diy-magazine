All you need is a long sweatshirt with the collar cut off so that it falls off your shoulders, worn with your lycra leggings and diy legwarmers, made by chopping the feet off the brightest pair of long socks you can find, then hemming up the raw edge. The side ponytail was also an 80s favorite.</p>
<h3 id="i-now-have-a-part-2-with-great-80s90s-homemade-cothes-here">I Now Have A Part 2 With Great 80S/90S Homemade Cothes Here.</h3><p>Workout clothes, tacky sweaters, and the iconic �80s rock and pop stars will inspire exciting costume ideas for years to come. It may sound unreal, but wearing underpants over the pants was a thing for men. What did the 80s fashion for women look like? All of these 80s decorations really take me back to such a simpler time in life.</p>
<h3 id="but-well-act-like-thats-not-true">But, We’ll Act Like That’s Not True.</h3><p>Consider pairing a bold blazer with biker shorts for a look straight out of the �80s, or pair it with a patterned midi skirt for a more modern vibe. Mixing different materials was very popular in the 80s. Put together some visually contrasting materials. Go to a local thrift store and look through what they have.</p>
<h3 id="from-fun-mixed-tapes-to-ideas-for-an-amazing-80s-party-outfit-these-ideas-have-you-covered">From Fun Mixed Tapes To Ideas For An Amazing 80S Party Outfit, These Ideas Have You Covered!</h3><p>There is one movie that evokes iconic 80s style and that is flashdance. Shoulder padded blazer this one is the formal attire in. It’s amazing to see how much technology has progressed today. For an authentic 80s look, try popping the collar of your shirt and drape a pastel colored sweater casually around your shoulders.</p>
