Runtal hydronic towel radiators are available in two basic designs: All these factors pair together to create a difficult environment for the bathroom radiators. To calculate the btu of your bathroom, you’ll need the width, height and length of your bathroom in metres and then make a note of each of these measurements.</p>
<h3 id="the-milano-passo-towel-radiator-in-the-image-above-offers-up-to-around-25-more-btus-per-hour-than-a-steel-towel-rail-of-similar-size-and-is-also-much-lighter-making-it-great-for-internal-stud-walls-that-you-perhaps-thought-would-not-be-strong-enough-to-support-the-weight-of-a-heavy-steel-radiator">The Milano Passo Towel Radiator (In The Image Above) Offers Up To Around 25% More Btus Per Hour Than A Steel Towel Rail Of Similar Size And Is Also Much Lighter, Making It Great For Internal Stud Walls That You Perhaps Thought Would Not Be Strong Enough To Support The Weight Of A Heavy Steel Radiator.</h3><p>If pipework is an issue, consider an electric bathroom radiator instead. The best way to ensure your towels stay toasty all year round, our range includes heated towel radiator options for every budget. The next step in determining the heat output and size required for your radiator is to determine how many radiators you would like to heat your desired room. The best bet is to assess it yourself, and weigh up the pros and cons of large to small sizes.</p>
