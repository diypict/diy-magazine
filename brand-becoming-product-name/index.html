Products like the fidget spinner and the snuggie went viral for their marketing, but they also had unique product names that were creative and easy to say. Our product business name generator was designed to make brainstorming easy with thousands of new product name suggestions generated for you at a single click of a button. It should be short, punchy and memorable the longer the name, the harder it is to grab people.</p>
