Lynne goldsworthy has put together this patchwork tutorial to show you how to foundation paper piece a 6in square economy block to get you started with this. Paper piecing, refers to sewing fabrics to a paper foundation to stabilize the quilt block due to unusual geometric shapes, small pieces or odd angles on a bias.

<h3 id="both-describe-the-actions-you039ll-take-when-sewing-a-foundation-pieced-quilt">Both Describe The Actions You�ll Take When Sewing A Foundation Pieced Quilt.</h3><p>Sometimes the paper foundation has a pattern printed on it, referred to as foundation paper piecing, like a log cabin block, where the fabrics are under the paper and the quilter sews directly on the stitching line as shown on. (the big needle will punch a bigger hole into the paper for easy removal). Use a very small stitch and a big needle. This free pattern from lillyella is amazing.</p>
