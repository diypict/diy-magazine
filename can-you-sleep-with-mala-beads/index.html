Meditating with mala makes the process easier as it provides a foundation, a ground, an object upon which to collect your wandering mind. Oiling will make the beads strong and they wonât dry out.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-delicate-brush-to-scrub-the-beads">Use A Delicate Brush To Scrub The Beads.</h3><p>While the uses and meanings of mala and prayer beads can be quite an extensive subject, this article will guide you through the basics of how these beads are correctly used. You would feel the connection of the body with the mind while you are taking deep breaths and meditating. Do not let your index finger touch the mala. People of every religious tradition will claim that their beads are for prayingâfor appealing to a higher power, for collecting the spirit or concentrating mindâand while this is indisputably true, that is not their primary purpose.</p>
