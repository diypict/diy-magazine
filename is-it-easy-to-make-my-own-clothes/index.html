Tunics are a great way to learn how to make clothes because they are simple to sew and always fashionable. Just like growing your own food changes your feelings about what you eat, making your own clothes changes your relationship to getting dressed. The creative hit you get from sewing doesn’t come close to buying something from a rail.</p>
<h3 id="we-all-have-that-one-blouse-that-we-never-use-and-are-too-guilty-to-throw-away">We All Have That One Blouse That We Never Use And Are Too Guilty To Throw Away.</h3><p>Have fun doing diy copy and paste to your wardrobe!! Yes, you can print on the sleeves of your custom clothes. To make clothing that hugs the body, it is best to lay pattern pieces on the bias (at a 45 degree angle to the folded edge). By sewing your own clothes, you can recycle that blouse into something you can be proud of.</p>
