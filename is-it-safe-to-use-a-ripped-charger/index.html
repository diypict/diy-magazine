Failed car USB charger teardown From epanorama.net
Hi, the 200 watt charger that came with my laptop died, but i have a 150 watt charger that came with my previous laptop. Would you suppose it would be safe to try to charge nexus s with the charger of xperia arc s? Its not charging the battery but the laptop works normal and not overheating or anything I have been using a note 2 charger for my s4.

<p>Is it safe to use or are the voltages different? You may not want to leave the computer/power cord unattended, just in case. Yes, it’s true that you could save a tiny amount of electricity by unplugging your chargers, but you could save a much larger amount of electricity by looking to heating, cooling, lighting, laundry, your computer and other more significant.

You may not want to leave the computer/power cord unattended, just in case. This is more likely when a device is plugged into the charger, however, your device is still pulling power while it’s plugged, meaning there always a chance that it could lead to an electrical fire.

The current draw (amperes) is controlled by the device you plug in. They refused to apologise and now i cannot appeal as the cable looks like it was damaged on purpose. So put very simply, leaving your charged phone attached to the charger uses 10 times the energy that leaving the charger dangling would.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-can-and-especially-if-the-water-it-fell-in-wasnt-clean-rinse-it-well-in-distilled-or-at-least-deionized-water-before-you-dry-it-out">If You Can, And Especially If The Water It Fell In Wasn’t Clean, Rinse It Well In Distilled Or At Least Deionized Water Before You Dry It Out.</h3><p>It is perfectly safe to plug a device that draws 1a into the 2a port and vice versa. Would you suppose it would be safe to try to charge nexus s with the charger of xperia arc s? I came across few cases of battery exploding in mobile phones ( samsung note 7 ) laptops ( don’t remember the name ) Apple refused and krcs had damaged it even more in the meantime.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-just-a-myth-or-is-this-true">Is This Just A Myth Or Is This True?</h3><p>My cousins always tell me that it is not safe to use or call someone on a mobile phone while charging it. That doesn�t seem like a. Can i charge the samsung buds pro with this charger? Just as the question reads.</p>
