<h3 id="highlight-exactly-what-you-do">Highlight Exactly What You Do.</h3><p>My first advice to anyone building a fashion business on instagram is to think as you are building a personal brand through instagram, so it means to think as you are creating your own fashion magazine. Master your hashtags, create quality content, connect with your community, and repeat. Create your fashion brand and identity. Narrow down your target audience.</p>
