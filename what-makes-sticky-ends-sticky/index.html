Ligate Sticky Ends via DNA Ligation SciGine From scigine.com
Make sticky ends when a restriction enzyme such as bamhi is used to cut the plasmid, it would cut the circle at one place. Physicist laurie winkless dives into the realm of surface science to figure out how its shaped our manufactured and natural worlds. These modifiers are nucleotide sequences that have sticky ends and attach to the blunt ends, thus making them sticky ends. I was reading this question here, and thinking, the kitten will come to a sticky end.
