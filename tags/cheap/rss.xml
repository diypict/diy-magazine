&lt;p&gt;Next, get the rag and soak that in the hot water. You should now allow the rag to sit on top of the tape until it cools down. I�ve tried both plastic and steel (very scary to use on paint) razor blades and they both just seem to remove the top portion of the tape, leaving a very thick and sticky residue that refuses to come off. Once off, you’ve likely got a layer of sticky residue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
