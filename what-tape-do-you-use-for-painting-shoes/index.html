<h3 id="i-like-to-wipe-mine-off-with-a-wipe-to-remove-any-dustdirt">I Like To Wipe Mine Off With A Wipe To Remove Any Dust/Dirt.</h3><p>You may want to tape off certain areas with masking tape to prevent overspray, i.e sole edges ; Design master floral spray paint. The blue painters tape that�s made by scotch will work. Once the paint dries, tape off the painted side using tape that is safe on 24 hour fresh paint.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-cloth-and-wet-with-stripper">Use A Cloth And Wet With Stripper.</h3><p>If you are using 1 inch like i did cut the tape in half. You�ll find it�s very hard to get a straight line, even with painters tape. Stuff toes of shoes with newspaper or plastic bags to create a smooth surface. You must put on rubber gloves first, because acetone is a really strong solvent.</p>
<h3 id="once-that-coating-has-worn-away-and-youve-let-the-shoe-dry-youre-ready-to-start-painting">Once That Coating Has Worn Away And You’ve Let The Shoe Dry, You’re Ready To Start Painting.</h3><p>The way you strip the wax coat is with acetone. The cheap stuff probably will. After that, use painter’s masking tape (or vinyl tape) to mask off the areas you don’t want to get paint. If this is your first time painting shoes, then hopefully you picked an easy design to start with.</p>
