Cardboard is generally easy to recycle. When your cardboard isn�t salvageable, you can still sell it for cash to a recycler. Also, the recycling company won’t pay as much for loose cardboard as they will for bundles that have been properly compressed. Once unpacked, these boxes are then discarded in the trash or dropped off at the city recycling bin.

<h3 id="scrap-cardboard-prices-can-vary-widely-but-you-can-expect-to-earn-between-50-cents-1000-per-ton-and-1-per-pound-2000-per-ton">Scrap Cardboard Prices Can Vary Widely, But You Can Expect To Earn Between 50 Cents ($1,000 Per Ton) And $1 Per Pound ($2,000 Per Ton).</h3><p>How do you recycle cardboard for cash? This is such a wasted opportunity since you can resell these boxes to companies that will pay 50 cents to $2 per box depending on its size. Make sure boxes are empty. Reuse is also better for the environment, reducing your company�s carbon and water footprints.</p>
