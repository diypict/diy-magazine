I am using 3m double sided tape for both my front and rear dashcams for a long time without any issue. Most adhesives have a limited temperature range, with their cool spectrum capping off at 10 degrees celcius or 50 degrees fahrenheit. DoubleSided NanoTape BareCrate.</p>
<h3 id="a-sharp-razor-blade-and-some-3m-adhesive-remover">A Sharp Razor Blade, And Some 3M Adhesive Remover.</h3><p>What temperature resistance do you need? 3m foam double stick tape, 5 psi holding force. Make sure it is cleared of any specks of dirt and also the surface must be dry. The internal strength of the tape holds the adhesive together.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-tape-or-the-surface-is-too-hot-or-too-cold-it-wont-stick">If The Tape Or The Surface Is Too Hot Or Too Cold, It Won’t Stick.</h3><p>Featuring a full 350 inches of tape, this durable mounting tool is designed to hold up to 15 pounds. 3m vhb double sided tape is much more durable, being able to on average take on freezing temperatures of 0 degrees celcius or 32 degrees fahrenheit. If it’s too cold, try to warm up the tape and the surface before application. Finish off with the rubbing alcohol to ensure all residue are removed.</p>
<h3 id="the-directions-for-the-lund-say-to-only-install-if-the-temp">The Directions For The Lund Say To Only Install If The Temp.</h3><p>The tailgate handle pieces did not come with instructions but are affixed with the same type of double sided tape. Is 60 degrees or warmer for proper adhesion of the tape. I was having some problems getting the first layer to stick nicely to the blue tape. Uv exposure should be reduced as much as possible in order to make tape stick as long as possible, it must be kept away from uv rays, or really, the sun as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="front-dashcam-is-on-the-same-3m-tape-since-july-2017-and-the-rear-dashcam-on-the-same-3m-tape-since-december-2018">Front Dashcam Is On The Same 3M Tape Since July 2017 And The Rear Dashcam On The Same 3M Tape Since December 2018.</h3><p>Rubbing alcohol if the surface is greasy, you will need a stronger solution like the 3m citrus base cleaner to cut the oil. These tapes stick to a wide range of materials including plastics, metals, foam, paper and printed graphics, providing a thin, smooth, flexible bond. Pros its transparent nature makes it look decent when in use you can easily cut it in any size according to your need it can be used many times cons it can’t be used on an uneven surface as it can rip them off 6 Uv rays will simply heat up the tape and cause one of the issues we have mentioned.</p>
