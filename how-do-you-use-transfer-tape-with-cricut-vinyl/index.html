Transfer tape is used for permanent vinyl, not. Heat transfer vinyl has a clear carrier sheet attached to the vinyl that is used instead. Transfer tape is used to transfer adhesive vinyl designs from the vinyl backing to the final surface where it will be applied.</p>
<h3 id="transfer-tape-is-basically-sticky-paper-or-vinyl-like-material-that-you-use-to-transfer-an-adhesive-vinyl-decal-to-your-surface">Transfer Tape Is Basically Sticky Paper Or Vinyl Like Material That You Use To Transfer An Adhesive Vinyl Decal To Your Surface.</h3><p>Now we are ready to get our transfer tape/vinyl combination on our surface! Your decal has now moved to the transfer paper and is ready to be carried to your project surface. Place the heat transfer vinyl onto the cricut mat with the shiny side facing down on the mat. Cut a piece of transfer tape slightly larger than each label.</p>
<h3 id="peel-up-the-transfer-tape-and-the-vinyl-should-come-with-it">Peel Up The Transfer Tape And The Vinyl Should Come With It.</h3><p>After weeding your decal, you pick up your design with the transfer tape (removing it from the backing) and lay it down on to your surface. What setting do i cut glitter vinyl on cricut? You do not need transfer tape with htv. I like to do this at a 45 degree angle slowly, making sure that all of the vinyl is sticking the transfer tape.</p>
