This involves designing clothes, sourcing materials for them, and producing them either by yourself or via a manufacturer. Whether you�re a designer seeking a platform to establish your own line, or you simply want to update your wardrobe with unique apparel, design your own. For example, if your clothing line is bold streetwear or grunge throwback apparel, you wouldn�t want to use a rounded font. When it comes to women�s fashion, high street shops often repress individuality as they all follow the same seasonal colors and patterns, but we believe in creating fashion, not following it.
