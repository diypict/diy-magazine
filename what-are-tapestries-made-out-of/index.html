Our tapestries are the opposite of bulky, they’re made of a lightweight silky poly that, while basically inept at keeping your castle warm (sryyy), are the easiest way to liven up. A tapestry is created by weaving coloured weft threads through plain warp threads. Tapestries have been used throughout history in different ways, from wall hangings, sofa back throws to floor cushions, wall claddings, and runners. The vertical threads are known as warps, and the horizontal threads are known as wefts.
