Combine a new bbq grill for your pool patio with a dining table or a comfortable sectional couch for the ultimate relaxing experience. Then you only have to wash them down every once in a while to remove dirt or mildew. This also can provide a place to sit around the edge or place pool toys, drinks, and so on.</p>
