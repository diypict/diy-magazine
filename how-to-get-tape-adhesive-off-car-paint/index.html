<h3 id="just-one-minute-with-a-hairdryer-heat-gun-or-even-a-blow-torch-will-do-the-trick">Just One Minute With A Hairdryer, Heat Gun Or Even A Blow Torch Will Do The Trick.</h3><p>Now you have a residue free surface. Don�t apply it directly to the paint. All it takes is a little time and some deliberate care, and most adhesives can be removed without damage to the finish. Depending on the area, it will take a few minutes but little effort to get the glue off completely.</p>
