Adding the towel bar in the bathroom is a good way for towel drying and storage. Choose a cabinet that is suitable to fit your bathroom size. A bathroom vanity is a convenient spot to choose.</p>

<h3 id="also-this-will-not-damage-the-vanity">Also, This Will Not Damage The Vanity.</h3><p>A towel bar is an excellent option in larger bathrooms because it gives you enough support and space to hang your towel.

Sleek and compact, they don’t need extra space as they can be set up on the walls on any side. We have two towel hooks on the toilet room wall across from vanity where our bath towels hang when not being used.</p>
