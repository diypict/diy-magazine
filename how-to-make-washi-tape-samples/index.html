Single washi tape on a bobbin.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-for-a-swap">This Is For A Swap.</h3><p>The basic idea is to wrap washi tape around a plastic surface. Let the diy washi tape dry on wax or parchment paper for best results, let them completely air dry. If your design is for 25mm width, file submitted should be 28mm width. That’s starting to look more like what we want.</p>
<h3 id="here-are-the-washi-tape-sampler-i-made-in-the-video-and-one-i-did-a-few-months-back-out-of-paper-and-plastic-sticky-paper">Here Are The Washi Tape Sampler I Made In The Video, And One I Did A Few Months Back Out Of Paper And Plastic Sticky Paper:</h3><p>Bigger works great for storing some different tapes in your hand bag or at the office. Add color and texture to your crafts and projects by accenting them with this beautiful washi tape. You can also make a sampler out of a used plastic gift card, or any size you like. Gradually rub with light linear or circular strokes and add small amounts of oil until all the surface of the paper is covered.</p>
<h3 id="finally-with-little-material-a-few-stamps-and-ink-colored-or-white-paper-you-will-create-your-own-designs-totally-unique-and-in-the-color-or-colors-you-have-chosen">Finally, With Little Material, A Few Stamps And Ink, Colored Or White Paper, You Will Create Your Own Designs, Totally Unique And In The Color Or Colors You Have Chosen.</h3><p>When you want to use a piece, peel off the waxed paper backing. If you didn�t know, washi tape is so cute and cool to use but it can be on the pricy side. In this example i make round stickers but you can make washi tape stickers in every shape you want. Playing cards (target has cute hello kitty ones that i use, it’s perfect and is more than enough) old gift cards (start saving them now!) laminated cards</p>
