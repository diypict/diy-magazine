<h3 id="sometimes-it039s-difficult-to-know-which-type-of-binding-to-use-for-your-project">Sometimes It�s Difficult To Know Which Type Of Binding To Use For Your Project.</h3><p>Double fold bias binding this is basically the single fold bias tape from above, folded in half. Single fold and double fold. Cut the strips 4 times the width of the bias tape maker.
