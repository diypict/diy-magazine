To read a tape measure, find the number next to the large tick, and then find how many small ticks past it the measurement is.</p>
<h3 id="add-the-number-next-to-the-large-tick-with-the-fraction-to-get-the-measurement">Add The Number Next To The Large Tick With The Fraction To Get The Measurement.</h3><p>It’s a lot longer than your standard ruler and much easier to use when you’re measuring a larger space or a piece of lumber. That means that once you�ve learned step 1, and know what the 1/8 marking looks like, you know that there are eight 1/8 marks in that inch. To read a metric measuring tape, find the nearest whole centimeter to the end point. A tape measure is used primarily for taking body measurements, as well as for drafting patterns, measuring fabric, laying out patterns on fabric, specifying the length of a garment, checking the size of hems, measuring curves and corners, measuring curtains, quilts.</p>
