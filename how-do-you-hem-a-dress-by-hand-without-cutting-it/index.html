Plan on spending at least 30 minutes to up to an hour and a half when sewing a hem by hand. This will be where you will cut the dress and fold the hem. If you’d like to do the rolled way, you’ll need to mark an extra 1/2″ on your pants so that it can be pressed and turned under, leaving a clean edge to sew.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-good-polyester-thread-to-make-sure-you-have-the-stretch-and-durability-needed-to-hold-the-hem-in-place">Use A Good Polyester Thread To Make Sure You Have The Stretch And Durability Needed To Hold The Hem In Place.</h3><p>Measure another line two inches below your desired length. To do this, put on your pants, fold the fabric inwards, then look in the mirror and adjust from there until you’re happy with the length. Remove the pins as you go; You would place the traced line 7 1/2″ up from the original hem.</p>
