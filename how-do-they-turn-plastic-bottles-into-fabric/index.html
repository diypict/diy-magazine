<h3 id="the-cap-of-a-soda-or-water-bottle-is-actually-a-different-kind-of-plastic-than-the-pet-bottle-itself">The Cap Of A Soda Or Water Bottle Is Actually A Different Kind Of Plastic Than The Pet Bottle Itself.</h3><p>The process is pretty straightforward. Clothing made from plastic releases microfibers. Those flakes are melted down into pellets, then the pellets are extruded (think spun and pulled like taffy) into yarn. The same plastic that’s piling up in landfill because it takes upwards of 500 years to degrade (if it degrades at all) and that’s destroying our oceans.</p>

Raw material gets turned into fabric. The biggest issue with recycled pet clothing is the microfibers they release. If we continue throwing plastic into the oceans, it’s estimated that by 2050.</p>
