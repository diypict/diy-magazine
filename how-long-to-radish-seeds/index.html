<h3 id="radish-seed-can-stay-viable-for-up-to-four-years-if-kept-in-cool-dark-conditions">Radish Seed Can Stay Viable For Up To Four Years If Kept In Cool, Dark Conditions.</h3><p>Remove any weeds, which compete with the radishes for water and nutrients, by removing them individually or hoeing between the rows. In frost free areas, sow in the fall. As soon as the soil can be worked, plant the radish seeds in a spot in the garden that receives full sun. Water the radishes as they grow.</p>
<h3 id="and-usually-75-percent-of-seeds-in-a-packet-will-germinate">And Usually 75 Percent Of Seeds In A Packet Will Germinate.</h3><p>Water your radishes thoroughly to moisten the soil to the rootlevel once or twice a week. Full sun regular watering well drained suitable for all climatic zones. Radishes are quick, easy and fun to grow from seed, ready to eat in as little as four weeks. Fill the entire area of your container with this planting technique.</p>
