<h3 id="bring-the-4-cups-of-water-to-the-boil-in-a-saucepan">Bring The 4 Cups Of Water To The Boil In A Saucepan.</h3><p>Here’s how it’s done so you can make your own spray starch at home! Mix together 2 ½ cups of tap water and 1 ½ tbsp cornstarch in a saucepan (make sure there are no lumps). But make sure you spray this right before you press the fabric, section by section. Make sure to mix well, so that there are no lumps left.</p>
