Do glue traps kill the animals? These devices have already been outlawed in new zealand, and ireland and petitions are underway to have them banned in the uk. But glue traps are not the answer.</p>
<h3 id="committed-to-become-the-world039s-respected-leader-in-the-adhesive-industry">Committed To Become The Worldï¿½s Respected Leader In The Adhesive Industry.</h3><p>In direct sunlight and extremes temperatures, glue trap wonât work well. Do glue traps have poison on them? Scientific testing (not in australia) revealed that of 40 mice stuck on glue boards, 35 survived for 24 hours during which they struggled to free themselves, and become coated in the glue. The traps, which use a strong adhesive to render animals who walk upon them unable to escape, are cheap and seemingly effective.</p>
