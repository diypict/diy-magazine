It is also called as the weft or filling of yarns. The basic difference between woven and knit fabrics is in the yarn or thread that composes them. Despite being successive stages of textile production, there is a huge difference between spinning and weaving. In the weaving process, two sets of threads interlace at right angles according to design to produce woven fabric.

Knitting is the process of taking one set of yarn and knit them with the help of two needles to make into fabric. Holding and puling the yarns tighter around the needles, creating stronger tension which makes the stitches tighter.</p>
<h3 id="the-warp-yarns-or-ends-run-lengthwise-in-the-fabric-and-the-filling-threads-weft-or-picks-run-from-side-to-side">The Warp Yarns, Or Ends, Run Lengthwise In The Fabric, And The Filling Threads (Weft), Or Picks, Run From Side To Side.</h3><p>B weaving uses two sets. The strength of warp knitting fabrics may be increased by using yarns of strong fibers, yarns of balanced construction, and a high gage with strong free yarns. In the weaving process, two sets of threads interlace at right angles according to design to produce woven fabric. For a beginner, it might take about 20 to 25 hours to create a cardigan with a simple design.</p>
