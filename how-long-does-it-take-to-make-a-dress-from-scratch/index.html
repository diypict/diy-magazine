I did not make the backside longer than the front side this time, however, since i made the skirts long enough to make a small train in the back anyway. Production factories usually sew the same pattern and have everything set up so they can do it quickly.</p>
<h3 id="since-this-instructable-features-the-little-black-dress-that-i-made-i-will-tell-you-exactly-what-i-did-and-what-i-learned">Since This Instructable Features The Little Black Dress That I Made, I Will Tell You Exactly What I Did And What I Learned.</h3><p>These days, more and more people are taking up sewing as a hobby, and whilst i will probably never be able to make a wedding dress or anything delicate or detailed, i.
